<p>Have you decided to suport our goal and made a pledge to pay the minimum shared cost? If so, please be sure that I have your committment on record by visiting the Funding link and verify I have recorded your intent. If not, please consider the benefit this will bring to you and your neighborhood. When you are ready, simply <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#98;&#111;&#120;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#53;&#57;&#116;&#104;&#99;&#116;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#101;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#32;&#109;&#101;</a></p>

<p>Are you willing to speak to your neighbors about the project and proposal? Visit the Funding link and see who has yet to show support and talk to those around you who are still on the fence about this topic. This is where I can really use your help. You may know your neighbor better thatn I and will give you the opportunity to have a more casual conversation about the need to upgrade our mail collection security. If anyone has any questions, they may <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#98;&#111;&#120;&#101;&#115;&#64;&#53;&#57;&#116;&#104;&#99;&#116;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#101;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#32;&#109;&#101;</a></p>

<p>Once we obtain the needed funds, the next step is the physical work. I hope to be able to see you when we break ground on our new mailboxes!</p>
