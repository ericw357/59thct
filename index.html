<h1><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">59th Ct&nbsp;&nbsp; Secured Cluster Mailboxes</span></h1>

<p>Replace the two aging central mailbox clusters with two Dark Bronze Model 1570-12 secured cluster mailboxes in the same locations. These cluster boxes will be purchased by the neighborhood and maintained by the neighborhood.&nbsp; The US Postal Service only manages the cluster box; they do not maintain the unit. If the unit becomes damaged in some form or another, the neighborhood is responsible for the shared cost of repair/replacement.</p>

<p><br />
I also contacted a local company in Olympia (B&amp;K Mailboxes) for the purpose of obtaining installation quotes. B&amp;K has installed a majority of the secured cluster boxes in the Olympia-Lacey area. You can see some of their installations at Lakepointe Park just off Yelm Hwy right before before the Amtrak Station **see map below**. He did recommend the Dark Bronze cluster boxes for aesthetics as opposed to the Light Tan or Grey models.</p>

<p><br />
The cluster boxes are all pre-configured. The standard cluster Boxes come in 8, 12, &amp; 16 unit configurations. This means there will be a number of unassigned/unused mailboxes depending on the final configuration.&nbsp;<br />
We are not obligated to utilize an installation contractor. I provided quotes from the contractor as an option. His prices for the cluster box units were lower than I could get from the manufacturer.</p>
