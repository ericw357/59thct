<h1><span style="font-family: times new roman,times,serif;">59th Ct&nbsp;&nbsp; Secured Cluster Mailboxes</span></h1>

<p>We have seen a spike in mail theft in the recent years here on 59th Ct. Mail theft can cause serious problems for its victims, most notably identity theft, which is the fastest-growing crime in the country. This crime is usually committed at night, by a team systematically checking unsecured centralized mailboxes.<br>
There’s a lot we can do to avoid becoming victims. Don’t leave your outgoing mail in the mailbox, put it in the letter slot at the post office or hand it to a carrier. Pick up your delivered mail promptly, don’t leave it in your mailbox all day or overnight. Unfortunatly, it is not possible for you to stand guard over your mailbox all hours of the day and night.<br>
How can we fix this? How can we prevent theft? How can we possibly have peice of mind that our outgoing and incomming mail will be secure once it leaves our hands? Let's not continue to be victims held hostage by the possibility that our mail is ripe for the taking. The mailboxes at 59th Ct are ready for an upgrade. Please take a moment to read over this website and consider the proposal for replacing our mailboxes with a more secured option that will serve this neghborhood for another 40 years.<br>
Replace the two aging central mailbox clusters with two Dark Bronze Model 1570-12 secured cluster mailboxes in the same locations. These cluster boxes will be purchased by the neighborhood and maintained by the neighborhood.&nbsp; The US Postal Service only manages the cluster box; they do not maintain the unit. If the unit becomes damaged in some form or another, the neighborhood is responsible for the shared cost of repair/replacement.</p>
